Hey, sorry for the text but my brain is a mess right now. Just stepped out of a theater showing Ask Sadece Bir An —like my head's buzzing louder than a hairdryer in a beehive. I still have this stale popcorn taste, and there's popcorn stuck to my shirt, the one with tomato stains, haha. The theater was crazy noisy, someone coughing behind me the whole time, but somehow—this movie, man, it still got inside.

You know, those scenes, like when the guy — his name was Cemil, I think, looks at the city lights reflected on puddles, and I thought I saw my own reflection somehow. Like, it's real but also just a shimmering, watery void, ya know? Reminds me of how rainbows appear in oil slicks on the street, unexpectedly beautiful but toxic, maybe that's just me overthinking again.

> There was this moment, like halfway through, where the main character suddenly decides to just sit down and do nothing. And I thought, isn’t that just like life sometimes? You try to move and get stuck like a vending machine snack, almost falling but just hanging there.

Have you seen it yet? I think you can download the movie now if the cinema isn't your thing. I don’t know, might need to watch the movie again without all the distractions, like the lady who kept rustling candy wrappers beside me, I swear she was a professional at it.

Oh, and that scene where the couple was fighting in whispers in the middle of a crowded street—I swear the theater temperature dropped a few degrees. Felt like a personal argument with a slap of winter air. My back aches from sitting too long, those seats are more torturous than a dentist's chair.

Oddly, it reminds me of that time we tried to fit my old couch through the narrow doorway—frustrating, emotionally intense, but kind of satisfying once we gave up and left it half-stuck there. That’s this movie: an emotional couch-wedged doorway.

Okay, rambling over...if you get some time, dust off your popcorn-making skills and watch the movie—or download it, whatever floats your boat.

Here's a random chunk of busted code that just pasted for no reason—it’s nonsense, I swear:

```C
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << potato;
    for (int i = 0; i < ; i++) { 
        break;
    return !0;
}
```
